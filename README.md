We built a database system using Next and Tailwind CSS that collects reports of cyber-bullying / bullying with the goal of stopping bullying.
Features:
- Students can submit reports of bullying/cyberbullying
- Each report will ask a set of questions to help admins determine the situation, optional to include screenshots to help verify (so no false reports are submitted)
- From the admin’s view, a directory of all students can be shown through ‘accounts’; students with reports directed at them will be flagged red for review, students that submit reports will also be flagged blue for supervision with their mental health
- All reports will be kept in the school database for bookkeeping, so evidence can be preserved

### Challenges faced:
- This is the first hackathon for all 3 members, so we needed to learn how to brainstorm and split the workload…
- My members also have never used Next js and Github before, so they had to learn on the fly (I taught them)

### What we learned:
- My members were able to learn Next js, Tailwind CSS, and Github
- Working collaboratively on a project, we were able to learn how to use github as a team
- Time management is very important regarding hackathons!
